# Federated-Learning-using-Cloudlets
This code repository uses a modified version of the FedProx repository (you can find it inside the FedProx folder) to support the idea of off-loading local training of Machine Learning models from edge device to cloudlets, which are mini-cloud networks.

## Steps to run
Steps to run are similar to the steps performed when running FedProx experiments, and as such you should follow the ReadME in the FedProx project to reproduce some of the graph plots attached in this repositiory.

## Main findings
